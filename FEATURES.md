## 1. Supported Brokers

QUANTEX-BOT fully supports **three brokers**. Each has its own live candle feed, payout data and result checking.

| Broker | OTC | Live | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟦 **QUOTEX** | 62 | 28 | **90** |
| 🟧 **TRADOWIX** | 101 | 15 | **116** |
| 🟪 **BINOLLA** | 104 | 17 | **121** |

- **Every feature works on every broker**: Live Session, Live Signal (both engines), all Checkers, all Future Signal modes, AXTIRON FS, AI Filter, Live Payouts, Market Filters and the Live Chart.
- **Broker selection**: each feature asks which broker you trade on. You can also set a **Primary Broker** (*Settings → Primary Broker*) and turn on **"Use this broker in all features"** so it is never asked again.
- **Broker-accurate markets**: lists, payouts, charts and signals always follow the selected broker.
- **BINOLLA** markets are loaded live from the BINOLLA feed, so new markets appear automatically. BINOLLA results are settled from the closed candle.

📋 **The complete market list for every broker, with names and counts, is in [SUPPORTED_MARKETS.md](SUPPORTED_MARKETS.md).**

---

## 2. Signal Engines — Strategy Mode & Scanning Mode

When you start **Live Session** or **Live Signal → Auto**, you choose between two independent engines (the admin decides which are available).

### ⚛️ Strategy Mode — three analyzers

| Analyzer | Focus |
|---|---|
| **QUANTUM SCAN** | Dynamic MTF + market structure + practical signals. Trend-continuation only. |
| **SMART FOCUS** | Focuses on the best-quality markets, with defended level and tick-pressure confirmation |
| **HYBRID ENGINE** | MTF + structure + trap detection. Takes continuation and properly confirmed reversals. |

Under the hood, 20+ independent analysis modules score each setup: Trend Continuation, Break of Structure, Change of Character, Engulfing Reversal, MACD Cross, RSI Divergence, Bollinger Breakout, Pin Bar, MTF Confluence, VWAP Reversion, Ichimoku, Fibonacci Pullback, candlestick patterns (Harami, Morning/Evening Star, Tweezer, Three Black Crows), Supertrend + PSAR, CCI Extreme and Multi-Indicator Confluence. A signal must then pass:

- a **confidence score** threshold (each analyzer has Normal / Standard / Hard presets),
- a **final closed-candle quality filter** (doji, wickless, abnormal-range and similar checks),
- a **primary trend gate** (Quantum and Smart Focus),
- and the admin's **signal controls** (enabled confirmation timeframes and setup types).

### 📡 Scanning Mode — shared zone & trendline scanner

One shared scanner watches **every open market of the broker at once**, continuously, and publishes a signal the moment a confirmed setup appears. Every subscriber receives the same signal at the same time.

| Setup | Description |
|---|---|
| **Supply / Demand Rejection** | Price taps a confirmed zone and rejects it with a strong wick |
| **Trendline Rejection** | Price rejects a clean, unbroken trendline in a trending market |
| **Trendline Break & Retest** | Price breaks a trendline, then retests it from the other side |
| **Zone Break Confirmed Retest** | A zone breaks, 1–2 pullback candles follow, then a retest confirms the break |

**Accurate level drawing (v5.0):**
- Zones are built from clustered swing points, and each touch is counted once (a flat top is one touch, not two).
- A zone that a later candle has **closed through** is treated as broken and is no longer used as supply/demand.
- A trendline must have well-separated anchors, and **no candle may close through it** between them. A line broken after its second anchor is marked broken: it is not used for rejections, only for break/retest.
- Signals never trade into an intact opposing zone or trendline.
- The signal chart shows **the exact zone or trendline** the signal came from as its support/resistance.

**Options:** M1 / M2 / M3 / M5 timeframes, optional higher-timeframe confirmation (M2–M15), payout ≥ 80% only, at most 2 signals per minute, and a 4-minute cooldown per market.

## 3. Strategy Intelligence

Strategy Intelligence is the layer that makes QUANTEX-BOT **better the longer it runs**. Every settled signal (WIN / MTG WIN / LOSS / DOJI) is stored with the analyzer that produced it, the market, timeframe, broker, hour and setup type (continuation or reversal). That history drives these decisions:

| Capability | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Per-analyzer learning** | Each analyzer is judged on **its own** record on each market. Results of different analyzers are never mixed. |
| **Hour → market → broker fallback** | It first looks at the same market at the same hour, then the whole market, then the whole broker, using the most specific scope with enough data |
| **Conservative scoring** | Win rates are ranked with a confidence-adjusted score, so 8 wins from 10 trades cannot outrank a proven 300-trade record |
| **Setup preference** | If continuation clearly beats reversal on a market (by 10+ points, or the other side wins under 45%), the weaker setup is skipped there. Otherwise both are allowed. |
| **Market ranking** | Markets with a strong record are scanned first. Markets that are clearly failing are skipped. |
| **Smart routing** | If the selected analyzer has 20+ results on a market and another analyzer is clearly better there (20+ results, at least 8 points higher, conservative win rate ≥ 50%), that market is analysed by the better analyzer. Admin switch: `/intelrouting on/off`. |
| **Safe auto-tuning** | When an analyzer keeps losing on a market (20+ results, win rate under 55%), one extra safety filter is switched on for that market, with at most 3 automatic changes. Admin reset: `/autotunereset` (a backup is kept). |
| **Recommended analyzer** | The analyzer menu marks the analyzer with the strongest proven 30-day record (minimum 20 results) as **RECOMMENDED** |
| **Scanning Mode statistics** | Every Scanning Mode signal is recorded with its setup, score, zone touches, hold time and result. Admins can review win rate by setup, score, zone touches, pair and hour with `/scanstats [days]`. |

The **Strategy Intelligence dashboard** in the Admin Web Panel shows win rates per analyzer, market, timeframe, hour and setup type, plus per-market *auto/manual* control and the audit log of every change.

---

## 4. Live Session

A continuous signal session that keeps scanning and posting to your channel or group until you stop it. **Requires a paid plan (STARTER, PLUS or INFINITY)**; its signals share the daily allowance with Live Signal.

**Setup wizard:** broker → channel / group → username → message style (Premium or Normal emoji) → market (OTC / Live / All) → Avoid under 80% or manual → engine (Strategy Mode analyzer or Scanning Mode) → pairs → timeframe (**M1, M2, M3, M5, M10, M15**) → charts → partial report interval → review & launch. Every button is explained in the [User Guide](guide/02-live-session.md).

- Signals arrive at the start of the next candle of your timeframe, with entry time, direction, confidence, payout and chart
- Results are checked after the candle closes, with automatic MTG on a loss
- **Session Status**, **Send Partial** and **Stop Session** controls
- Real-time **Session Log** in the web app
- Saved setups can be re-run or scheduled

---

## 5. AI-Assisted Live Signal

### Manual Signal
Choose a market and timeframe and receive one **AI-confirmed** signal on demand.

### Auto Signal
The bot scans all markets (or your filter: OTC, Live, Avoid under 80%, or manual selection) and sends the strongest setups automatically, in **Strategy Mode** or **Scanning Mode**.

### Group Live Signal
The **bot owner** (in practice, the owner of a Q-BOT STUDIO bot) adds the bot to a Telegram group as an admin and sends `/start_live_signal`. Live Signal then runs **inside the group**, with owner-only controls for start, stop, status and partial reports.

### What each Live Signal includes
- Direction, entry time and timeframe
- **Live broker payout %**
- **Support & Resistance** (in Scanning Mode, the exact zone or trendline the signal came from)
- **AI confirmation** with a confidence level and a short written reason (Strategy Mode)
- A professional signal chart, and a result chart after the candle closes
- Daily quota display and custom templates (header, owner name, branding)

```
📊 LIVE SIGNAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Pair         : EUR/USD OTC
Direction    : ⬆️ BUY (CALL)
Entry Time   : 14:35
Payout       : 87%

---

## 10. News Signal System

AI-powered trading signals derived from the Forex Factory **economic calendar**.

### How It Works

**Step 1 — Calendar Fetch**  
QUANTEX-BOT pulls live economic event data from the Forex Factory JSON feed. No Selenium, no scraping — reliable structured data.

**Step 2 — Filter Events**  
Events are filtered by:
- **Impact Level** — HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or All
- **Day Range** — events for the next 1, 2, or 3 days ahead
- **Currency** — only currencies relevant to your selected trading pairs

**Step 3 — AI Direction Analysis**  
Each event is sent to the Gemini AI model, which assigns:
- **BULLISH** or **BEARISH** bias for the event currency
- **Confidence score** (60–95%)
- **Rationale** — 1–2 sentence explanation

**Step 4 — Heuristic Blend**  
If AI analysis is unavailable, a built-in heuristic engine derives bias from `forecast vs previous` (with inversion logic for unemployment, jobless claims, etc.).

**Step 5 — Technical Structure Blend**  
A lightweight 30-day technical read (trend + momentum) is blended with the fundamental bias. Agreement boosts confidence; disagreement reduces it.

**Step 6 — CALL/PUT Pair Mapping**  
The currency bias is automatically mapped to CALL and PUT recommendations across all your selected pairs:
- Currency BULLISH → CALL on base pairs, PUT on quote pairs
- Currency BEARISH → PUT on base pairs, CALL on quote pairs

### Supported Pairs — 29 Pairs
```
EUR/USD · GBP/USD · USD/JPY · USD/CHF · AUD/USD · USD/CAD · NZD/USD
EUR/GBP · EUR/JPY · EUR/CHF · EUR/AUD · EUR/CAD · EUR/NZD

## 26. Performance & 24/7 Stability

v5.0 was engineered to be **super fast** and to run **non-stop for weeks**.

| Area | What changed |
|---|---|
| **Analysis speed** | The market analysis engine runs about **14× faster**, and candle-file reading about **6× faster** |
| **Instant buttons** | Button taps are acknowledged immediately, more taps are handled in parallel, and heavy screens are cached |
| **Web apps** | Web Control, HUB, Live Chart and admin pages run on separate worker loops, so one slow request can't freeze the others |
| **Efficient data** | Shared caches for candles, payouts and settings, with reused Telegram and database connections |
| **Self-healing** | Stuck market scans, stalled result checks and frozen web loops are detected and recovered automatically |
| **24/7 launcher** | A supervisor restarts the bot automatically if it ever stops or freezes and logs the reason |
| **Long-run safety** | Memory caches are bounded and old data is cleaned up automatically, so the bot stays fast after weeks of uptime |

---

## 27. Admin Control Panel

Available to the bot owner and delegated sub-admins through Telegram commands and a browser-based **Admin Web Panel** (users, plans, pairs, brokers, signal controls, Strategy Intelligence dashboard, Studio administration and more).

> Details of admin controls are not publicly disclosed.

---

## 28. Database — PostgreSQL Backend

QUANTEX-BOT uses **PostgreSQL** for all persistent storage.

All data is managed through a dedicated `db_postgres.py` module with connection pooling for efficient concurrent multi-user access.
