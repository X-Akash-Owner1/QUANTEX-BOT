## 📌 General

### What is QUANTEX-BOT?
QUANTEX-BOT is an automated binary options trading signal system on Telegram. It uses a proprietary multi-factor analysis engine combined with AI confirmation to deliver high-confidence BUY/CALL or SELL/PUT signals with real-time charts, payout data, and automatic result tracking.


### Do I need to join a channel?
Yes. You must be a member of our **main channel** [t.me/bdtraderpro](https://t.me/bdtraderpro) to use the bot. All updates, new features and announcements are posted there first. If you leave it, the bot asks you to rejoin and tap **Verify Membership**.

### What's new in v5.0?
- **3 fully supported brokers**: QUOTEX, TRADOWIX and BINOLLA (300+ markets), plus a **Primary Broker** setting
- **Super-fast and stable**: the analysis engine is about 14× faster, buttons respond instantly, and the bot runs 24/7 with self-healing and automatic restart
- **Q-BOT STUDIO** *(coming soon)*: build your own bot in 8 steps from ready-made templates, with no coding
- **Strategy Intelligence (rebuilt)**: learns from every result and favours the analyzers and setups that win on each market
- **Scanning Mode**: a new shared supply/demand zone and trendline engine, with accurate level drawing
- **QUANTEX HUB** community, **Live Chart**, **AXTIRON FS**, **AI Filter** and **Group Live Signal** (for bot owners)

### What broker should I use?
Any of the three: **QUOTEX**, **TRADOWIX** or **BINOLLA**. All are fully supported with OTC and Live markets. Pick your broker in each feature, or set it once in **Settings → Primary Broker**. The full market list is in [SUPPORTED_MARKETS.md](SUPPORTED_MARKETS.md).

## 📡 Signals & Accuracy

### How accurate are signals?
It depends on market conditions. In clean, trending markets a 70–85% win rate is common. In choppy markets the bot sends fewer signals to protect quality. Strategy Intelligence keeps learning from real results, so quality improves over time.

### How often does the bot send signals?
At the start of each candle of the timeframe you choose (M1–M15). A signal is sent only when a setup passes every filter, so frequency depends on market conditions. In Scanning Mode, signals are shared the moment a confirmed zone or trendline setup appears.

### What is a DOJI result?
A DOJI candle means the open and close price are equal (no movement). QUANTEX-BOT detects these and reports them separately — they are not counted as WIN or LOSS in your win-rate.

---

## 🤖 AI Signal Confirmation

### What does AI confirmation add?
In Live Signal mode, every signal is additionally validated by an AI model that checks market conditions, calculates support/resistance levels, fetches real-time payout data, and provides a written reason. This is an extra quality layer on top of the base signal engine.

### Can the AI reject a signal?
Yes. If the AI determines the setup is not strong enough, it overrides and blocks the signal from being sent.

### What is "Support & Resistance" in the signal?
Key price levels automatically calculated and included in every Live Signal. Support = price floor. Resistance = price ceiling. They give context for the trade entry.

---

## ⏱ Future Live Signal System

### What is Future Live?
You paste a pre-planned signal list and QUANTEX-BOT automatically sends each signal to your channel at the exact scheduled time, waits for the candle to close, checks the result, and sends WIN/LOSS — all fully automated.

### What signal formats does Future Live accept?
Any format — the universal parser handles everything:
```
▢ 05:50 USDIDR ⇨OTC ☞ PUT
M1 EURUSD_OTC 06:00 BUY
USDCAD-OTC 05:53 PUT
```

### How many Future Live sessions do free users get?
**3 sessions total** (lifetime) for free users. Subscribed users have unlimited sessions.

---

## 🔍 Signal Checker

### What is the Checker Suite?
QUANTEX-BOT includes these checker modes:
- **Live Checker** *(New)* — WIN/LOSS check for real/live market signals
- **OTC Checker** — standard WIN/LOSS check for OTC signals
- **Blackout Checker** — direction-free signals checked using reverse previous-candle logic
- **Whiteout Checker** — direction-free signals checked using follow previous-candle logic
- **Custom Date Checker** — check signals for any specific past date

### What is the Live Checker?
The Live Checker works exactly like the OTC Checker, but for **real (live) market pairs** instead of OTC pairs. Paste your live market signals and receive instant WIN/LOSS/DOJI results.

### What makes the checker "super-fast & 100% accurate"?
The checker uses a **local candle cache** with a pre-built time index for O(1) lookups — no external API calls needed. Candle data is compared directly (open vs close), not estimated. Results are exact.

### What is the Blackout Checker?
For signals that have no direction. The checker looks at the **previous candle** — if it was GREEN, expected direction is PUT; if RED, expected direction is BUY. Then it checks the entry candle against that expected direction.

### What is the Whiteout Checker?
Same as Blackout but logic is reversed — previous GREEN → expected BUY; previous RED → expected PUT.

### What is the Payout Filter?
Set a minimum payout threshold (e.g., 80%). Signals below that threshold are flagged with their actual payout % so you can decide whether to skip them.

### What is the Custom Date Checker?
Check signals for any past date — not just today or yesterday. Bot fetches archived candle data for the chosen date.

## 📰 News Signal System

### What is the News Signal?
The News Signal system generates trading signals based on the **Forex Factory economic calendar**. It fetches upcoming economic events (e.g. NFP, CPI, interest rate decisions), analyzes the expected impact using Gemini AI, and produces CALL/PUT recommendations for each of your selected pairs.

### How does it determine direction?
In three layers:
1. **Heuristic** — compares `forecast vs previous` for the event, with inversion logic for negative metrics (e.g. unemployment rate)
2. **AI Analysis** — Gemini AI provides BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL bias with a confidence score and rationale
3. **Technical Blend** — a 30-day technical structure read (trend + momentum) is blended with the fundamental bias to adjust confidence up or down

### Which pairs are supported by News Signal?
29 pairs: all major forex pairs (EUR, GBP, USD, JPY, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD combinations) plus XAU/USD.

### Can I filter by news impact level?
Yes — you can filter events by **HIGH**, **MEDIUM**, **LOW**, or show **All** impacts.

### How many days ahead can I see?
1, 2, or 3 days ahead from the current time.

### Is the AI re-run for every user requesting the same event?
No — analysis results are **cached per event** (keyed by title + currency + exact release time). The first user requesting an event pays the AI cost; everyone else requesting the same event within its window gets the cached result instantly. Cache expires after the event's release time.

---

## 🛠️ Signal Tools

### What are the Signal Tools?
Four utility tools for working with signal lists, accessible from the main menu:

- **Signal Formatter** — paste any signal list, receive it reformatted into a clean, standardized card layout
- **Swap C/P** — *coming soon*: will flip every CALL to PUT and vice versa
- **TZ Converter** — paste signals, enter source and target timezone → receive time-converted signals
- **Market Filters** — shows which live markets are currently stable and tradeable

### Who can use the Signal Tools?
All users — the tools are available to FREE, STARTER, PLUS, and INFINITY subscribers.

---

## 💳 Auto Payment

### What is the Auto Payment system?
A self-serve subscription system that lets you activate your plan **instantly inside the bot**, without contacting the owner. Supported methods: **Binance Pay**, **TRC20 USDT**, and **BEP20 USDT**.

### How does it work?
1. Tap **Upgrade** inside the bot
2. Select your plan (STARTER, PLUS, or INFINITY)
3. Choose a payment method
4. Send the exact USDT amount to the provided address/ID
5. Bot verifies payment automatically and activates your subscription immediately

### How long do I have to complete payment?
**60 minutes** from the time you initiate the request. After that, the request expires and you can start a new one.

### Is manual payment still available?
Yes — you can always contact [@X_Akash_Owner](https://t.me/X_Akash_Owner) directly if you prefer manual activation.

## 🧠 Analysis Engine & Strategy Intelligence

### Does QUANTEX-BOT learn from its results?
Yes. Strategy Mode has **3 analyzer engines** built on **20+ independent analysis modules**, and every settled result (WIN / MTG WIN / LOSS / DOJI) is recorded per analyzer, market, timeframe, hour and setup. **Strategy Intelligence** uses that history to steer future signals (see below).

| Analyzer Engine | Description |
|---|---|
| **QUANTUM SCAN** | Dynamic MTF + Structure + Practical Signals |
| **SMART FOCUS** | Best Quality Market Analyzer |
| **HYBRID ENGINE** | MTF + Structure + Trap detection, continuation and confirmed reversals |

### What are the 20+ analysis modules?
Each signal passes through independent modules including: Trend Continuation, Break of Structure, Change of Character, Engulfing Reversal, MACD Cross, RSI Divergence, Bollinger Breakout, Pin Bar, MTF Confluence, VWAP Reversion, Ichimoku Confluence, Fibonacci Pullback, Candlestick Patterns (Harami, Morning/Evening Star, Tweezer, Three Black Crows), Supertrend + PSAR, CCI Extreme Reversal, and Multi-Indicator Confluence. Only signals where multiple independent modules agree are delivered.

### Does the bot get better over time?
Yes. **Strategy Intelligence** learns from every settled result. It judges each analyzer on its own record per market, timeframe and hour, prefers the setup type (continuation or reversal) that clearly works better, ranks the strongest markets first, can route a market to an analyzer that has proven clearly better there, and tightens filters, carefully and within limits, where results stay weak. The longer the bot runs, the more data it has and the better its decisions become.

### What is Strategy Intelligence?
The learning layer behind Strategy Mode (see above). Admins also get a browser dashboard with win rates per analyzer, market, timeframe, hour and setup, per-market auto/manual control and a full change log. For Scanning Mode, `/scanstats` shows win rate by setup, score, zone touches, pair and hour.

### What is the minimum signal confidence threshold?
Each analyzer has its own confidence threshold with **Normal / Standard / Hard** presets set by the admin. A signal must also pass the closed-candle quality filter and the trend gate. Anything below the threshold is discarded silently.

## 📡 Strategy Mode vs Scanning Mode

### What is the difference?
**Strategy Mode** uses three analyzers (QUANTUM SCAN, SMART FOCUS, HYBRID ENGINE) guided by Strategy Intelligence. **Scanning Mode** is one shared scanner that watches every open market at once and trades confirmed **supply/demand zone** and **trendline** setups. Both are available in Live Session and Live Signal → Auto.

### Are the zones and trendlines drawn correctly?
Yes. Zones that price has already closed through are discarded, each touch is counted once, and trendlines must be clean, with no candle closing through them. The signal chart shows the exact level the signal came from.

## 🌐 QUANTEX HUB & Live Chart

### What is QUANTEX HUB?
The built-in community: posts with images, likes, comments, direct messages, leaderboards, profiles and daily market news with breaking-news alerts.

### What is the Live Chart?
A candlestick chart for every market of all three brokers, M1 → D1, with 30 days of history and live updates, right inside Telegram.

## 🔮 AXTIRON FS & AI Filter

### What is AXTIRON FS?
An advanced future signal generator. Choose OTC or Live, a timeframe (M1–M15) and a duration (1–5 hours).

### What is the AI Filter?
Paste any future signal list (OTC, Live, Blackout or Whiteout). Each entry is scored against 1–7, 7–15 or 15–30 days of history, and the strongest ones are returned as a new list.

---

## 💎 Telegram Premium Mode

### What is Premium Mode?
Connects your own Telegram account so signals are sent with Telegram **Premium animated emojis** for a more visually distinctive format in the checker and signal outputs.

### Do I need Telegram Premium?
Yes, Premium animated emojis are only displayed correctly to users with an active Telegram Premium subscription.

### Is it safe to connect my account?
Yes. Login is handled through a secure browser WebApp (**OTHERS → Login**). The session is encrypted, 2FA is fully supported and login links expire automatically. Check the connection anytime with **TG Status**.

---

## 🔄 MTG (Martingale)

### What MTG levels are available?
- **Non-MTG** — single signal only
- **MTG 1** — one recovery step
- **MTG 2** — two recovery steps

### Is MTG automatic?
In Live Signal mode, the bot sends the MTG analysis/signal. In Future Live mode, MTG fires automatically at the next candle. Whether you place the actual trade is your choice.

---

---

## 📋 Session Log Viewer

### What is the Session Log Viewer?
A real-time diagnostic log that records every event in your active live signal session — which pairs were scanned, which signals were generated, which were rejected and why. Accessible from the Web Control dashboard and from the Q-BOT STUDIO Child Admin Panel.

### Does closing the log page lose my data?
No — the log keeps running in the background regardless of whether the page is open. Reopening the page shows the full accumulated history.

---

## 🔒 Trust & Safety

### Is QUANTEX-BOT a scam?
No. QUANTEX-BOT has an active **public community group** — [t.me/quantexlounge](https://t.me/quantexlounge) — where users share real results, both wins and losses, openly. A bot with poor performance couldn't survive that kind of open scrutiny for long. The product is actively maintained and transparently run.

### Can I be sure the bot performs well before paying?
We recommend **backtesting** the signals in demo mode first, so you can verify performance yourself before subscribing or trading real funds. Binary options trading carries real risk, and no signal service — including this one — can promise a 100% win rate.

### Is it safe to connect my Telegram account (Premium Mode)?
Yes. The connection is handled through a secure, encrypted login flow. Your credentials are never exposed or shared, and are stored safely for the sole purpose of verifying your account and enabling Telegram Premium emoji formatting.

---

## ⚠️ Risk Disclaimer

Binary options trading carries high risk. QUANTEX-BOT provides signals to assist your decisions — it does not guarantee profits. Only trade with money you can afford to lose.

**Recommended money management:**
- 1–5% of balance per trade maximum
- Set a daily loss limit
- Never chase losses with bigger stakes

---

## 🌐 Website & Developer API

### Is there a website?
Yes: **[quantexbot.pro](https://quantexbot.pro)** (also in [বাংলা](https://quantexbot.pro/bn) and [Português](https://quantexbot.pro/pt)). It has the documentation, pricing, updates, FAQ, a contact form, the live [system status](https://quantexbot.pro/status) and your account dashboard. Signals and trading tools stay in the Telegram bot. Details: [WEBSITE.md](WEBSITE.md).

### What is the Developer API?
A REST API at `https://api.quantexbot.pro/v1` for your own apps and bots: brokers, pairs, payouts, candles, the **live signals the bot delivers and their results**, future signal lists, the checker and economic news. Full documentation: [DEVELOPER_API.md](DEVELOPER_API.md) or [quantexbot.pro/docs/api](https://quantexbot.pro/docs/api).

### How do I get an API key?
[Create an account](https://quantexbot.pro/register), verify your email, then open **Dashboard → API keys**. The free Developer plan is included; the key is shown only once.

### Which plan do I need for live signals, webhooks or the stream?
Live signals, results and future lists start from **Starter**. Webhooks, the live stream and candle history are in **Pro** and **Business**. See [quantexbot.pro/pricing](https://quantexbot.pro/pricing).

### Are API signals the same as the bot's signals?
Yes. The API serves the signals the QUANTEX bot really delivers, each setup once, and the WIN / LOSS result later with the same id. The API never runs a separate analysis.

### How do I pay for an API plan?
In **Dashboard → Upgrade plan** with Binance Pay, USDT TRC20 or USDT BEP20. Paste the transaction ID; it is verified automatically and the plan starts at once.

### Can AI assistants read the documentation?
Yes, everything is public: [quantexbot.pro/llms.txt](https://quantexbot.pro/llms.txt), [quantexbot.pro/llms-full.txt](https://quantexbot.pro/llms-full.txt) and the [OpenAPI file](https://api.quantexbot.pro/v1/openapi.json). In this repository: [llms.txt](llms.txt).
