## Executing a Signal on QUOTEX, TRADOWIX or BINOLLA

1. Open your broker (QUOTEX, TRADOWIX or BINOLLA) and log in
2. Select the **pair** from the signal
3. Set the expiry to the signal's **timeframe** (M1 = 1 minute, M5 = 5 minutes, …)
4. Set your **stake amount**
5. At exactly the **entry time**, click **Higher** (BUY) or **Lower** (SELL)
6. Wait for the candle to close. The bot sends the result automatically.

> ⏰ Enter within the first 5–10 seconds of the signal minute.

---

## Timeframes & Entry Timing

Signals are aligned to the **timeframe you choose**: M1, M2, M3, M5, M10 or M15 in Live Session, and M1, M2, M3 or M5 in Scanning Mode.

```
M1 :  14:31  14:32  14:33  14:34 ...
M5 :  14:30        14:35        14:40 ...
```

A signal always gives the **start time of the entry candle**. If no strong setup is found, the bot simply waits. It never forces a trade.

## Strategy Mode vs Scanning Mode Signals

| | Strategy Mode | Scanning Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Engine** | QUANTUM SCAN / SMART FOCUS / HYBRID ENGINE | Shared zone & trendline scanner |
| **Setups** | Trend continuation (+ confirmed reversals in Hybrid) | Zone rejection, trendline rejection, break & retest |
| **Extra** | AI confirmation, Strategy Intelligence | Exact zone/trendline shown on the chart |

## Signal Tools

### Swap C/P *(coming soon)*
Will flip all directions in a signal list — every CALL becomes PUT, every PUT becomes CALL. The button is in the menu but the tool is not active yet.

### TZ Converter
Have signals in a different timezone? Paste them and select your target timezone — the bot converts all entry times automatically.

### Signal Formatter
Paste any signal list in any format — the Formatter normalizes and outputs a clean, standardized card. Useful for re-sharing or archiving.

### Market Filters
Shows which live market pairs are currently in **stable, tradeable conditions** — helps you avoid choppy pairs before starting a session.

## Common Mistakes

❌ Late entries (30+ seconds after signal time)  
❌ Overleveraging (10%+ stake per trade)

❌ Emotional revenge trading after losses  
❌ Trading News Signals on extremely low-impact events
