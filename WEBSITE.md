- **Sessions** page: see every signed-in device and sign the others out.
- **Password reset** by email; leaked-password check; sign-in rate limits and Cloudflare Turnstile against bots.
- **Notifications** in the dashboard and by email (payments, plan expiry, security events, webhooks).
- **Telegram link**: connect your Telegram account so payment and plan news also reach you in the bot.
- **Account deletion** on request, with a grace period.

## 🔌 Developer API on the website

Full documentation: **[DEVELOPER_API.md](DEVELOPER_API.md)** (also at [quantexbot.pro/docs/api](https://quantexbot.pro/docs/api)).

| Dashboard page | What you do there |
|---|---|
| **API keys** | Create keys (shown once), choose permissions (scopes), optional IP allow-list and expiry, rotate the secret, revoke |
| **Webhooks** | Add your HTTPS address, choose events and filters (broker, market, timeframe), see the signing secret once, **Send test**, see recent deliveries |
| **API usage** | Requests per day and per endpoint, monthly quota |
| **API logs** | Every request of the last 90 days (time, endpoint, status, latency, request ID) — request bodies and keys are never stored |
| **My APIs** | Which endpoint groups your plan includes, and from which plan the others are available |

## 💳 Buying an API plan

1. **Dashboard → Upgrade plan** → choose Starter, Pro or Business.
2. Choose **Binance Pay**, **USDT TRC20** or **USDT BEP20**. The order shows the exact amount (with a small unique fraction), the Pay ID or wallet address and a QR code; it is valid for 60 minutes.
3. Pay, then paste the **transaction ID**.
4. The payment is **verified automatically** against Binance / the blockchain (receiver, currency, exact amount, time, confirmations; a transaction can be used only once). The plan starts at once, limits apply immediately and a receipt is emailed.
5. Reminders are sent 7 days and 1 day before the plan ends; renew or upgrade at any time.

> Bot Access packages (STARTER / PLUS / INFINITY) are bought inside the Telegram bot — see [PRICING.md](PRICING.md).

## 🤖 QUANTEX AI support assistant

A chat assistant on every page of the website and dashboard:

- Answers in **English, বাংলা and Português** from the official QUANTEX knowledge base (with links to the right page).
- Inside the dashboard it can read **your own** plan, payments and API usage to answer account questions.
- Keeps your conversation history; **Send to support** hands a conversation to the team.
- Works without any outside AI service (built-in knowledge engine); an AI model can be plugged in by the admin.

## 🟢 System status

[quantexbot.pro/status](https://quantexbot.pro/status) is checked **every minute** from the server:

| Component | What is checked |
|---|---|
| Website | quantexbot.pro answers |
| Developer API | api.quantexbot.pro answers |
| Database | accounts, plans and keys |
| Market data engine | brokers, pairs, payouts, candles, checker, news |
| Telegram bot | the bot's live heartbeat |
| Payments | Binance Pay / USDT verification |

The page shows a 90-day uptime bar per component, current incidents with updates, and past incidents. The same data is available as JSON at `GET https://api.quantexbot.pro/v1/status` (no key).

---

## 🌍 Languages

English (at `/`), বাংলা (`/bn`) and Português (`/pt`). The dashboard and emails use the language chosen in your profile. More languages can be added from the admin panel.

## 🧩 How the website, the API and the bot fit together

See **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** for the full picture. In short:

```
quantexbot.pro (website + dashboard)      api.quantexbot.pro (Developer API)
                 \                            /
                  └──── QUANTEX web platform ┘
                               │  results only (signed, local)
                        QUANTEX Engine Bridge
                               │
          QUANTEX Telegram bot · market data collectors · signal engines
```

The website and the API never run trading analysis themselves: they read the results the QUANTEX engine already produced, so thousands of API users never slow the bot down.
