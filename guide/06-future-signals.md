# 6 · Future Signals

[⬅ Back to the User Guide](../USER_GUIDE.md)

A **future signal list** is a list of trades for later today, e.g. `M1 EURUSD-OTC 14:35 CALL`. You copy the list and take each trade at its time. QUANTEX-BOT has several generators plus tools to filter and auto-post lists.

| Feature | What it makes | Plan |
|---|---|---|
| **OTC MARKET FS** | A list for OTC markets | FREE 2 · STARTER 3 · PLUS 10 lists/day · INFINITY unlimited |
| **LIVE MARKET FS** | A list for real markets | same allowance |
| **BLACKOUT FS** | A blackout-style list | same allowance |
| **WHITEOUT FS** | A whiteout-style list | same allowance |
| **AXTIRON FS** | A premium list for one chart, 1–5 hours | STARTER 3 · PLUS 10/day · INFINITY unlimited · FREE: admin allowance |
| **AI FILTER** | Keeps only the strongest signals of any list | Paid plans · FREE: admin allowance |
| **FUTURE LIVE** | Posts your list live to a channel with results | FREE 3 sessions · paid unlimited |

All times use the timezone set in **SETTINGS → CHANGE TIMEZONE** for that feature.

## 6.1 OTC / LIVE / BLACKOUT / WHITEOUT FS

These four buttons work the same way. Tap one (choose broker if asked).

### Step 1 — Choose the logic
**⚙️ SELECT YOUR FUTURE SIGNAL LOGIC**

| Button | What it means |
|---|---|
| **NEW FS LOGIC** | Back-tests every chosen market's time slots on recent history and keeps the slots that won most consistently (recommended) |
| **OLD FS LOGIC** | The classic generator with System / Strategy / Quantity choices |
| **Back** | Main menu |

> If the admin paused a mode you see *"THIS FUTURE SIGNAL MODE IS TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE."*

### Step 2 — Start time
Send `HH:MM`, e.g. `09:00`.

### Step 3 — End time
Send `HH:MM`, e.g. `23:59`. It must be after the start time.

---

### NEW FS LOGIC — the next steps

| **BOTH** | Both directions |

**FILTER LEVEL**:

| Button | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **HIGH** | Strictest: fewer, more consistent slots |
