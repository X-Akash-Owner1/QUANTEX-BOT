# 4 · Live Signal

[⬅ Back to the User Guide](../USER_GUIDE.md)

**Live Signal** gives you signals **inside your own chat with the bot**, with a chart and an automatic result. There are two modes: **Manual** (you pick the market, one signal now) and **Auto** (the bot keeps finding signals for you).

## A · MANUAL SIGNAL

### Step 1 — Market type
| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **OTC MARKET** | Lists open OTC markets |
| **LIVE MARKET** | Lists open real markets |
| **Back** | Back to Live Signal |

### Step 2 — Pick a market
Every open market is listed with its **current payout**, e.g. `EUR/USD-OTC (92%)`. Use the page buttons to see more. Tap one.

- *"This market is currently closed."*: choose another.
- *"⏳ This market is cooling down for four minutes after a signal."*: the same market cannot be signalled again for 4 minutes. Choose another.

### Step 3 — Timeframe
**M1 · M2 · M3 · M5 · M10 · M15** (or **BACK**).

### Step 4 — Analysis and the signal
The bot shows **🔍 Analyzing (pair) — Scanning market data…**, runs the analyzer, and waits for the final confirmation window near the end of the current candle. You then receive the signal card:

- pair, **CALL ⬆ / PUT ⬇**, entry time, timeframe, payout, confidence, owner name, and a chart.

Open the trade at the **entry time** with the selected expiry. After the candle closes you automatically receive the **result** (WIN / LOSS / DOJI) with a chart.

> ⚠️ **One signal at a time.** Until the current signal's result arrives you see *"⚠️ Signal Pending Result — You cannot create a new signal until the previous signal's result is received."*

### Step 5 — Running

## D · Group Live Signal (for bot owners)

Live Signal can also run **inside a Telegram group**. This is controlled by the **owner of the bot**, so it is mainly used with your own bot made in [Q-BOT STUDIO](13-qbot-studio.md):

1. Add your bot to the group as an **admin**.
2. In the group, the owner sends **`/start_live_signal`**.
3. The group menu **📡 GROUP LIVE SIGNAL** offers **MANUAL SIGNAL**, **AUTO SIGNAL**, **BROKER** (choose QUOTEX / TRADOWIX / BINOLLA), **SETTINGS** (owner name) and **BACK**.
4. Set up the mode like in sections A/B, review the summary and tap **CONFIRM & START**.
5. Control buttons in the group:

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **START LIVE SIGNAL** | Starts (or shows the setup menu) |
| **SEND PARTIAL** | Posts a partial; **RESET PARTIAL** clears it |
| **SIGNAL STATUS** | Shows whether it is running and its settings |
| **STOP LIVE SIGNAL** | Stops the group signals |

If the bot is not an admin it says *"ADD THIS BOT AS A GROUP ADMIN, THEN TRY AGAIN."* Other group members cannot press the controls.
