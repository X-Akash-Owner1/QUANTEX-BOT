### ⭐ QUANTEX EXPERT V1 *(PLUS / INFINITY)*

*"Premium adaptive trading intelligence with high-confidence next-candle signals, smart confirmations and real-time performance insights."*

**How it works: it picks the best strategy for this chart by itself.**

1. Needs at least **210 candles** of history.
2. It back-tests **12 entry strategies × 8 filter combinations = 96 setups** on the **last 120 candles** of the current pair and timeframe:

| # | Entry strategy (BUY / SELL) |
|---|---|
| 1 | Price crosses the **Hull MA 13** up / down |
| 2 | Price crosses **SMA 8** with RSI above / below 50 |
| 3 | **EMA 7 / EMA 21** crossover |
| 4 | EMA 7/21 crossover **in the direction of EMA 200** |
| 5 | Price re-enters the **Bollinger Bands (20, 2)** from the lower band / falls back from the upper band |
| 6 | Close breaks the **10-bar high / low** |
| 7 | **RSI 14** crosses back above 30 / below 70 |
| 8 | EMA 7/21 crossover confirmed by RSI and **relative volume** |
| 9 | **MACD (12/26/9)** crosses its signal line |
| 10 | **Engulfing-style reversal** candle |
| 11 | Close breaks the **5-bar high / low** |
| 12 | Price above / below **VWAP** plus a **fair-value gap or order block** |

   Filters that can be combined with each strategy: **EMA 200 trend filter**, **RSI band filter** (BUY 35–75, SELL 25–65), **volume filter** (relative volume ≥ 0.5).
3. Each setup is scored: **60% win rate + 25% number of signals + 15% consistency** (recent 30 candles vs the whole window). Setups with fewer than 8 signals are skipped when possible. The best one is used.
4. **Live signal:** in the **last 30 seconds** of the running candle, if the chosen setup triggers, the chart shows **BUY NEXT** or **SELL NEXT** for the next candle. Once issued for that candle it does not change.

**What is drawn:** EMA 7 (yellow), EMA 21 (cyan), VWAP (orange, only when the VWAP strategy is chosen), the 20-bar lowest low (green) and highest high (pink) channel, and the signal/result labels of the back-test.

**Expert panel:**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **TOTAL SIGNALS** | Signals of the chosen setup in the last 120 candles |
| **WIN SIGNALS / LOSS SIGNALS** | Wins (direct + MTG) and losses |
| **WIN RATE** | Wins ÷ total |
| **LAST SIGNAL** | The live BUY NEXT / SELL NEXT, or the last result |
| **MARKET PRESSURE** | Bull vs bear pressure of the last 20 candles (candle body × volume), shown as a 3–97% slider. Above 50% = buyers stronger |

---

### ⭐ AXTIRON TR V1 *(PLUS / INFINITY)*

*"Non-repainting next-candle signals with Pine-style pivot-strength S/R zones, QQE confirmation and a live market-state panel."*

**1. Support / Resistance zones.** Pivot highs and lows (default **pivot period 14**, from candle **close/open**) over the **loopback** window (default 290 candles) are grouped into channels no wider than **4%** of the recent range. Each channel gets a **strength** = 20 × pivots inside + candle touches. The strongest non-overlapping channels are drawn (up to **10**):

- **red** = resistance (above price), **green** = support (below price), **grey** = price is inside the channel.

**2. QQE signal engine.** A smoothed RSI with QQE trailing bands (RSI length, smoothing, **QQE factor 0.238**, threshold, sensitivity). When the smoothed RSI crosses its band a raw BUY or SELL appears.

**3. Price-action filter** (on by default). A BUY is kept only if the candle is **near a support zone**, has a **long lower rejection wick** (> 0.8 × body) or is a **bullish engulfing**. SELL mirrors this with resistance, upper wick and bearish engulfing.

**4. Non-repainting.** Signals are calculated only on **closed candles** and saved, so a printed BUY NEXT / SELL NEXT never disappears.

**Dashboard panel (top-left or bottom-left):**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **SUPPORT RESPECT** | Share of zone touches where price is holding above support |
| **RESISTANCE RESPECT** | Share of zone touches where price is holding below resistance |
| **BREAKOUT RATE** | How often candles closed through a zone |
| **TOTAL TOUCHES** | Touches across all drawn zones |
| **LAST SIGNAL** | BUY NEXT / SELL NEXT |
| **Market state** | **RESPECTING MARKET** (breakout rate ≤ 15%, levels hold, so bounces are better) or **BREAKOUT MARKET** (> 15%, levels break often) |

A badge shows the pair and timeframe.
